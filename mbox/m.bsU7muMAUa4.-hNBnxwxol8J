Although I am not a technical expert (I have guys for that), I would be 
interested in your views on web accessibility with regard to cloud based 
solutions. It occurs to me that many of us 'procure' social cloud apps that 
may not be as accessible as they should be. WAI-AA is a minimum standard in 
the public sector. 

As digital communicators sometimes responsible for introducing new cloud 
apps you may be legally responsible for checking their compliance even if 
they are free. Are you doing this?

As background, you might be interested in this Blog
