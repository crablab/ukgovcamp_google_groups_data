Hi all, 

I'm the policy officer for technology here at the GLA and looking forward 
to Govcamp here at City Hall tomorrow, my first Govcamp as a public sector 
newbie. 

Wanted to give you all a link in advance to our Smart London<http://www.london.gov.uk/smart-london>plan, that we published at the end of last year. Would love to get 
attendees no holds barred feedback on it during the various discussions. 

Related - I'd love to have a discussion on city datastores<http://data.london.gov.uk/>
/dashboards <http://data.london.gov.uk/london-dashboard>. What's worked 
well (inc data.gov.uk, in UK cities > data.london.gov.uk, and outside the 
UK, eg New York), what hasn't, what future datastores/dashboards should 
look like.
