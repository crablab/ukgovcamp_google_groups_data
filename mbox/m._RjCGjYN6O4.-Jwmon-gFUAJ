 LocalGov Digital <http://sites.idea.gov.uk/localgovdigital/> is a 
practitioner led organisation for people doing digital stuff in and around 
local governments.

In October 2013 we launched our Content Standards<https://github.com/LocalGovDigital/content-standards>to help improve what's published on local governments' websites and this 
year we're doing a lot more, including expanding the LocalGov Digital 
Designers and Developers Network<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/114124478761452023264/stream/dec19009-8967-404f-b0fc-4237d718cbbf?partnerid=gplp0>
.

If you work in or around the Local Government sector and you create, code, 
develop or design for digital is this something you'd like to join and 
collaborate with and if so how can we help you do this?
